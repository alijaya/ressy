Okay this library is from manaGearz...
I think it will be nice to separate this from main engine
It is a resource management library, so it will handle the resource pain when you build swf from haXe

It feature is:
1. get your resource with access the folder and file
2. you can use 2 mode in this library, you can load the resource in runtime, and you can embed the resource in your swf. Changing from a mode to another is so simple, just change few line, and the rest of the code don't need a change.
